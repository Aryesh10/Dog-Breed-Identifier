## Introduction

Dog breed classification is a challenging yet exciting task in the field of computer vision. This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify dog breeds from images accurately.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of dogs labeled with their respective breeds. The data is explored and visualized to understand the distribution of different breeds and other characteristics.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the model used)

Install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dog-vision.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd dog-vision
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4. Run the `Dog Vision.ipynb` notebook to explore the data and train the model.

## Model Training

The notebook includes detailed steps for data preprocessing, visualization, and model training. Key steps include:

- Loading and exploring the dataset.
- Visualizing the distribution of breeds.
- Preprocessing images for model training.
- Building and training a CNN model for classification.

## Results

The results section of the notebook showcases the performance of the trained model, including accuracy and other relevant metrics. Visualizations of the predictions are also provided to illustrate the model's effectiveness.
